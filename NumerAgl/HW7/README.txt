IGNORE ALL WARNING! THEY are caused by the way the Linux
system treats the ending \r\n symbol, which is different from the way the
windows does. Simply type make run. Everything should be fine. The output is
also attached. Cheers!
Note for code:
As for the code, I reused code I had before to set up matrix but modified it
so that the matrix is allowed to be rectangle rather than simply square.
Besides that, all new code is in the ExplicitFD.h or .cpp files. I wrote the
code with naming conventions that are quite self-explainary. So,I didn't
leave many comments. Hope that doesn't bother.
