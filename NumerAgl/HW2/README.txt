// Just type make run and follow the below the result matches.
// I tested several numbers with non integer inputs and 
// the result matches with the Matlab output.
// To note that: I used part of the code last time. So, please do not be
// surprised with the fact that I used OO style for this homework but
//didn't implement copy constructor and '=' operator in the 
//Shaw_Traub_Poly struct. They are just not needed.
// Cheers!
